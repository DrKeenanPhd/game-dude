# Cloud-to-SDK Converter Tool

This tool helps you convert GAME cloud configuration JSON files into SDK-compatible TypeScript files.

## Overview

If you have an existing GAME configuration JSON file from the cloud platform, you can use this tool to automatically generate the necessary TypeScript files for SDK integration.

## Usage

1. Place your GAME cloud JSON file in the tools/cloud-to-sdk directory
2. Run the conversion tool with the following command:
   npm run cloud-to-sdk -- <your_json_file>

This will create an `output` directory containing:
- agent.ts - Contains the GameAgent configuration
- worker.ts - Contains worker definitions
- functions.ts - Contains function implementations

*note: the functions generated are currently incomplete, they just contain function name, description and a boilerplate implementation, you will need to implement them.
